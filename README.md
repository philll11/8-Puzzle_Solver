# 8-Puzzle Solver
This application solves the 8-puzzle problem using 4 different search algorithms, with and without memorization lists:
*  Breadth-first search with a Visited List
*  Breadth-first search without a Visited List
*  Progressive Deepening search without Visited List
*  Uniform Cost search using Expanded List
*  A* search using Misplaced Tiles
*  A* search using Manhattan Distance

## This application was built to satisfy the first assignment for the Massey University Artificial Intelligence paper 159.302.

The 6 algorithms are located in the algorithm.cpp file.
