# 8-Puzzle Solver
This application solves the 8-puzzle problem using 4 different search algorithms, with and without memorization lists:
*  Breadth-first search with a Visited List
*  Breadth-first search without a Visited List
*  Progressive Deepening search without Visited List
*  Uniform Cost search using Expanded List
*  A* search using Misplaced Tiles
*  A* search using Manhattan Distance

The 4 algorithms are located in the algorithm.cpp file.
