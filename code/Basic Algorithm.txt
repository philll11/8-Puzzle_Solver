Basic algorithm:

1) Initialise Q with search node (S) as only entry; set Visited = (S)

2) If Q is empty, fail. Else, pick some search node N from Q.

3) If state (N) is a goal, return N (we've reached the goal).

4) otherwise Remove N from Q.

5) Find all the descendants of state (N) not in visted and create all the one-step extensions of N to each descendant.

6) Add the extended paths to Q, add children of state (N) to visted.

7) go to step 2
